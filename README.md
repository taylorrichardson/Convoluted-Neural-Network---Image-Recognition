Followed tutorial from;
https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/convolutional-neural-networks-python (Which was excellent)

To create an image recognition CNN (Convoluted Neural Network).

It uses keras and TensorFlow primarily to construct the neural net.

After adding in drop out layers it has a f1-score of 91%, which is excellent. 

Was a very fun learning exercise to see how this process when.
